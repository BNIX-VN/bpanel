"""Model Context Protocol: letting an AI assistant operate the panel.

An assistant holding a personal token reaches the panel over MCP and gets
exactly the permissions of the person who made the token. An administrator's
token sees the whole server; a customer's sees their own websites, databases,
backups and files and nothing else.

Three ideas carry the whole design.

**Hide rather than refuse.** A tool the token may not use does not appear in
`tools/list`, and calling it by name answers "Unknown tool" - the same answer a
name that does not exist gets. A read-only token cannot discover that the
writing tools are there, and a customer's token cannot discover the
administrative ones. Refusing by name would turn the tool list into an
enumeration oracle.

**Call the endpoints, do not reimplement them.** Every tool that does anything
calls the API's own endpoint function, passing `db=ctx.db` and
`current_user=ctx.user`. Ownership checks, quota, audit and the helper
boundary then live in one place and cannot drift between the panel and MCP. A
website is found by domain, and somebody else's website is reported as not
existing rather than as forbidden - "forbidden" would confirm it is real.

**No new dependency and no new listener.** The JSON-RPC here is a few hundred
lines rather than the `mcp` package, and it answers on the panel's existing
port behind the panel's existing certificate.

Transport is Streamable HTTP in its plain-JSON form: no SSE, no sessions. GET
and DELETE on the endpoint are 405.
