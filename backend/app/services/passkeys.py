"""Passkeys (WebAuthn), bound to the hostname the panel is being reached on.

Two things shape everything here.

**A credential belongs to a hostname.** WebAuthn's Relying Party ID is a
domain, and a browser will not so much as admit that a credential exists to any
other name. app/serve.py answers on every hostname on the machine that has a
certificate, so the panel derives the RP ID from the request rather than from a
setting, and stores it on the credential. An account can then hold one passkey
per name it actually signs in through.

**A passkey is never the only way in.** Because of the above, signing in at a
name the passkey was not registered for offers nothing - so TOTP stays live
beside it and the login falls through. A second factor that can strand a
customer on the wrong hostname is not a security feature.

The library does the cryptography. What is worth reading here is the boundary:
what is trusted from the browser (nothing, beyond what the library verifies
against a challenge we issued), and what is derived on the server (the RP ID
and the origin, both from the request, never from the payload).
