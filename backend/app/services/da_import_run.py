"""Run one DirectAdmin import in its own process.

The panel used to run imports in a ThreadPoolExecutor inside bpanel-api. A
multi-GB import takes minutes, and anything that restarts that service during
one - an update, a crash, an operator - killed it halfway. What was left was a
half-created account: the panel user and the Linux user existed, the website,
the database and the files did not, and the job record was an in-memory dict
that went with the process, so the page had nothing left to report.

Systemd starts this instead, through the helper, and it outlives bpanel-api.
The unit's own state is the job state, which is why it survives a restart:
there is nothing in memory to lose.
