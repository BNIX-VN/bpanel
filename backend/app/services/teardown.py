"""What has to go when a panel account goes.

Three code paths delete a user: DELETE /api/users/{id}, the billing-driven
terminate_account, and the DirectAdmin importer's replace-existing step. They
drifted, and the drift was invisible because the panel database does not
enforce the cleanup it declares.

Two tables were re-parented onto users by later migrations and neither
deletion path followed:

  database_accounts   Migration 0014 added owner_id and 0015 made website_id
                      nullable, so a database can belong to a user and to no
                      website - which is the only kind the UI now creates
                      (api/databases.py). Both paths looked for databases by
                      website_id, so those rows survived their owner with a
                      dangling owner_id, and their MariaDB accounts were never
                      dropped. 0014 creates the owner foreign key only on the
                      non-SQLite branch, and the shipped backend is SQLite, so
                      nothing at the database layer noticed.

  site_apps           Migration 0025 declared ON DELETE CASCADE on owner_id and
                      the deletion paths were written as though it would run.
                      It does not: core/database.py never issues
                      PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON, so SQLite ignores it. What
                      actually happened was worse than an orphan - User.apps is
                      a plain one-to-many, so SQLAlchemy tried to null the
                      child's owner_id, the NOT NULL column rejected it, and
                      the whole delete raised IntegrityError *after* the Linux
                      account and the websites' files were already gone.

da_import._delete_existing_user has always swept databases by owner_id. This
module is that sweep, extracted so the three paths cannot drift again.
