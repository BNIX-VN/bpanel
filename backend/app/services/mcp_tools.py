"""The tools an assistant can actually call.

Separate from `mcp.py` on purpose: that file is the transport and the
permission model, this one is the surface area. They change for different
reasons and at different rates, and a reviewer reading one should not have to
scroll past the other.

Every tool here calls the API's own endpoint function rather than reaching
into a service or the database. That is the single most important rule in the
file. Ownership checks, quota, audit and the sudo helper boundary all live
inside those endpoints; a tool that went around them would be a second
implementation of the panel's permission model, and the two would drift.

Websites are addressed by domain, because that is what a person says to an
assistant and what the assistant reads in a log. Somebody else's domain is
reported as not existing - never as forbidden, which would confirm it is real.

Importing this module is what registers the tools. `app.api.mcp` imports it
for that reason and uses nothing from it.
