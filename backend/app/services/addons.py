"""Optional parts of the panel, installed only where they are wanted.

Everything here is off until an administrator asks for it. A server that hosts
WordPress has no reason to carry a container runtime, its firewall rules or its
upgrades, and a customer has no reason to see a section of the panel their
package does not include.

The state lives beside the panel's other settings rather than in the database,
so the answer to "is this installed" costs nothing and is available to code that
has no session to hand.
