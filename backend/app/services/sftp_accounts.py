"""Extra SFTP logins, each pinned to one website.

A panel user's own Linux account already reaches every site they own, with the
panel password. That is the wrong credential to hand a freelancer: it opens
every other site on the account, and it is the same secret that logs into the
panel.

A sub-account is a real Linux user - OpenSSH has no virtual ones - that shares
the site owner's uid and is chrooted to a root-owned directory holding a bind
mount of exactly one website.

Two decisions carry the security of this module, and both are deliberate:

  the shared uid    Files the sub-account uploads land with exactly the
                    ownership the owner's own upload would produce, so PHP-FPM
                    keeps write access, WordPress can still update itself in
                    place, and disk quota counts against the right account. The
                    cost is that the uid grants nothing less than the owner
                    has, which is why the chroot is the boundary and the
                    account gets no shell, no exec and no forwarding.

  the chroot root   /var/lib/bpanel-sftp, owned by root, NOT under
                    /var/lib/bpanel. That directory belongs to the panel
                    account, and OpenSSH is right to refuse a chroot whose
                    parents are writable by anyone but root: such a chroot is
                    not a boundary at all.

The login name is generated rather than chosen. It has to be unique across the
whole machine, fit Linux's 32 characters, and stay inside the sftp_ namespace
that keeps it from ever colliding with a panel user.
