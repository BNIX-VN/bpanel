"""Object storage as a backup destination, and what the stored file is called.

The panel could already push a backup to an SSH server. Most hosts have object
storage instead - Wasabi, Backblaze B2, DigitalOcean Spaces, Cloudflare R2, a
MinIO box, or S3 proper - and they all speak the same API.

`minio` rather than `boto3`: boto3 pulls botocore, which carries the service
definitions for every AWS product and adds roughly 100 MB to a venv that is
162 MB to begin with. That lands on every customer machine, for one feature.

**Naming is the interesting part.** What a scheduled backup is called at the
far end decides how many files accumulate there, and on metered storage that
is a bill:

    none            user-alice.tar.gz             one file, overwritten
    day_of_week     user-alice-Mon.tar.gz         seven, rotating
    week_of_month   user-alice-W3.tar.gz          five, rotating
    full_date       user-alice-2026-09-23.tar.gz  one a day, pruned by retention

The first three bound storage without deleting anything - the oldest copy is
simply overwritten when its turn comes round again. That is a different
guarantee from retention, which deletes, and it is the one you want when the
thing doing the deleting is the machine that might be compromised.
