"""The schedule that ran every night and saved nothing.

    ok 0 user(s); sieunhim: [Errno 13] Permission denied:
    '/var/backups/bpanel/users/sieunhim'

The panel owns /var/backups/bpanel and creates account directories one level
below it, in /var/backups/bpanel/users. Nothing ever created that middle
directory - not install.sh, not the helper - so it belonged to whichever
process reached it first. Where that was a root one it came out root:root
0755, and from then on the panel could read it and not write in it. Every
scheduled backup for every account failed, and the only trace was an errno in
the schedule's last message.

Three layers, because each covers a case the others cannot:
  install.sh  creates it correctly on new servers
  update.sh   repairs the ones already out there
  the helper  fixes it at the moment a backup needs it, whatever put it back
