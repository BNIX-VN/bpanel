"""clamd is installed for scan-on-upload and for nothing else.

maldet runs every scheduled, on-demand and real-time scan, and it calls
`clamscan` with both signature sets on the command line - it never opens
clamd's socket. So a daemon left running beside it is a second resident copy of
the same ~1 GB of signatures.

That was not theoretical. On a live 8 GB server, 16 OOM kills in 7 days:

    Sep 18 22:13  clamd     1.56 GB      Sep 21 01:40  clamd     1.14 GB
    Sep 18 22:18  clamscan  0.87 GB      Sep 21 01:40  clamscan  1.05 GB
    Sep 18 22:18  nginx     0.69 GB      Sep 21 15:50  clamd     2.17 GB
                                         Sep 21 15:50  nginx     0.71 GB

clamd in 9 of the 16, twice taking nginx down with it. clamscan held ~1 GB
throughout - the size of the signature set, and unavoidable.
