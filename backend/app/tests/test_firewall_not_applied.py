"""A firewall that is on as a setting must not be shown as on while nothing
enforces it.

A server built from a July image was updated straight to v1.0.170. The update
ran the July updater, which predates the iptables + ipset firewall: ipset was
never installed, UFW kept filtering, and the panel's chain was never applied.
The admin pressed "Turn on", which saved "enabled" before failing on the
missing ipset. From then on the dashboard and the alert said the firewall was
off (the chain is not active) while the Firewall page said "On" (the saved
setting). Both pages now read the chain, and the page offers the repair that
the missing update step would have done.
