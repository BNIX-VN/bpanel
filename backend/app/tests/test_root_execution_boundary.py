"""Root must never execute a file the panel account can write.

installer/files/bpanel-sudoers hands `bpanel` a NOPASSWD wildcard on
bpanel-helper, and the helper's whole design is that it validates the argv it
receives. That boundary is worth nothing if root separately reads bytes the
same account owns.

installer/update.sh runs as root and does, with the cwd set to backend/:
    source .venv/bin/activate      - runs the file in the root shell
    .venv/bin/pip install ...      - runs a binary from the venv
    .venv/bin/python -m py_compile - `python -m` puts the cwd on sys.path

while both installers used to `chown -R bpanel:bpanel $APP_DIR/backend`, venv
included. Ownership alone is enough: an owner can always chmod. And the same
account can fire the root execution itself, because the `updates-panel-run`
helper verb takes no arguments and has no guard beyond SUDO_USER=bpanel.

rsync carries --filter='protect /.venv', so anything planted there survives an
update; and the recreate guard only fires when .venv/bin/uvicorn is missing,
which on a healthy install it never is.
