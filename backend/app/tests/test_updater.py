"""The updater must apply its own changes in the run that brings them in.

bash reads a script as it runs, so update.sh re-execs a copy of itself from
/tmp - a copy of the *previous* release. Without a handover, anything an update
changes about updating itself lands one release late, which is how a server
once kept running the old panel start-up script after the release that replaced
it.
