"""Scanning an upload is opt-in, and off is the default.

The scan costs whatever the scanner costs. With a resident clamd that is a
socket round trip. With the one-shot clamscan the panel installs by default it
is a full signature load per file: 28.2 s and 1.05 GB for a 20 MB upload,
measured on a live server. That is not a price every upload should pay by
default, and the scheduled maldet scan covers the files either way.
