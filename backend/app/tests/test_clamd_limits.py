"""clamd's stock limits, and why the panel raises them.

Two settings decide whether an upload is really examined. StreamMaxLength is a
hard refusal - an INSTREAM body over it is rejected mid-send, which the panel
sees as a broken pipe. MaxFileSize is not a refusal at all: clamd answers OK on
a larger file without reading it, so "clean" and "never looked" come back
identical. Padding a payload past the stock 25 MB walked it through.
