"""A removed package must not read as installed.

`dpkg -s <pkg>` exits 0 for a package that has been removed but kept its
config files - dpkg calls that state "deinstall ok config-files". The binaries
are gone; only /etc leftovers remain. Every caller in this repo means "is this
usable", so for such a package the honest answer is no.

Found on a live server right after v1.0.147 removed clamav-daemon: dpkg -s
still reported it, so `install_clamav_daemon` would have skipped `apt-get
install` and then failed on `systemctl enable --now clamav-daemon`, because
/usr/sbin/clamd no longer existed. Turning scan-on-upload back on would have
been broken on exactly the machines that had removed the daemon.
