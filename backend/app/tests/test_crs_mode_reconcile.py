"""A lost CRS setting must not quietly take CRS off every site.

There are two records of the same fact. The panel settings hold what an admin
chose; /etc/nginx/modsec/bpanel-crs-mode holds what was last deployed. Every
re-render of a site's rules asks active_crs_mode(), and a missing settings key
read as "off".

That is not hypothetical. On a live server the settings file lost the key, an
update re-rendered every site, and 20 customer sites ran without CRS for
seventeen minutes. Nothing was logged: to the renderer, "off" is a perfectly
ordinary answer.

So a missing key now defers to what is deployed, loudly. An explicit "off" is
still obeyed - that is a decision, not a gap.
