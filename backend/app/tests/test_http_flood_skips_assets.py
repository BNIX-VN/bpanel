"""The connection limiter was turning away paying visitors.

Measured on a live server: two WooCommerce shops, 113 and 413 requests
refused in one day. Every one was a .js or .css, and 432 of the 526 carried a
gclid - somebody who had just clicked a paid advert. They got the shop with
its stylesheet missing.

Nothing was attacking. nginx counts each HTTP/2 stream as a connection, and a
WordPress page with two hundred plugin assets opens more concurrent streams
than any sane connection limit. One visitor, one page view, reads as a flood.

The fix uses the mechanism the challenge cookie already relies on: nginx does
not count a request whose limit key is empty. Static files now get an empty
key. Nothing is lost - nginx serves them from disk without touching PHP or the
database, which is what the limiter exists to protect.
