"""Translation: the dictionary, the fallback, and the switch.

The design rests on one property - a string with no translation renders in
English rather than blank or as a key - so most of what is worth testing is
that the property holds and that nothing has drifted out of sync with it.

These read the source rather than running a browser. The panel has no
JavaScript test runner, and the things that break here are textual: a key that
no longer matches any string, a Vietnamese word left in the English source, a
t() wrapped around a page key.
