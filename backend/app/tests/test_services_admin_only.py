"""The Services page describes the machine, not a customer's slice of it.

system-info gives the kernel and hostname, resource-usage gives the whole
box's CPU and memory, and list/action say which system units are installed and
running. None of that belongs to one hosting customer; all of it helps somebody
sizing up the host.

All four were open to end users. The page was visible to them too, but hiding a
page in the frontend is not access control - a session cookie and curl reach
the same endpoints.
