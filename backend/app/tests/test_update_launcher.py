"""bpanel-update fetches the updater of the release it installs, then runs it.

It used to be a full copy of update.sh from the release already installed, so
an update ran the steps of the release it was leaving. A server built from a
July image updated straight to v1.0.170 with its July steps: the iptables
firewall migration never ran, UFW stayed in charge, and the panel said the
firewall was off (2026-09-29). The operator's rule since: the command on a
server only fetches the updater from git, so what an update installs or
removes is decided in the repository.
