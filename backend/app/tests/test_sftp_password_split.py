"""The panel password and the SFTP password are two secrets now.

Before migration 0033 they were one. Every path that changed a panel password
also wrote it to the account's Linux user, and sshd offers password
authentication to that user on port 22 from anywhere. So:

  a brute force against SFTP yielded the panel password, and a panel password
  is root, because the panel account holds a NOPASSWD sudo wildcard on
  bpanel-helper;

  and a leaked SFTP password - handed to a freelancer, pasted in a deploy
  script, stored by an FTP client - was a full panel compromise.

What the tests below are really guarding is one rule: **no password a user
typed into the panel may reach chpasswd.** Everything else here is the
consequence of that rule meeting a database full of accounts that were created
before it existed.
