"""Object storage as a backup destination, and what the stored file is called.

The naming mode is the part that carries a guarantee. A schedule set to
`none` overwrites one file per account; `day_of_week` rotates through seven;
`week_of_month` through five. Those three bound what accumulates in a bucket
without anything having to delete - which is the guarantee you want when the
machine that would do the deleting is the one that might be compromised.
`full_date` keeps one a day and grows until retention prunes it.
