"""The night unattended-upgrades deleted a customer's MySQL extension.

On 2026-09-23 at 06:16, unattended-upgrades removed php8.3-mysql from a
customer VPS. Three WordPress sites answered "Your PHP installation appears to
be missing the MySQL extension" until someone noticed.

It was not a distribution accident. apt's autoremove takes any package that is
marked auto-installed and that nothing depends on, and every PHP extension is
exactly that: php8.3-mysql is a leaf, installed as a dependency of nothing.
Ubuntu ships Remove-Unused-Dependencies as false for this reason. BPanel's own
apt config set it true, so we asked for the deletion.

Two independent guards, because either one alone leaves a hole: the setting
can be turned back on from the panel, and `apt autoremove` typed by hand
ignores the setting entirely. Marking the packages manual survives both.
