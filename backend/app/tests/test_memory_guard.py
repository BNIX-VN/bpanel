"""Keeping a memory spike from taking the web server down with it.

Written after a real outage. On a 7.9 GB server with no swap, clamd had grown
to 2.1 GB; a customer's PHP cron job asked for memory; the kernel's OOM killer
took clamd, then an nginx worker. Twenty-six customer sites stopped answering
for two and a half minutes. Nothing was misconfigured - the machine had no
slack, and no policy about who should die first.

The guard does three things, and the tests here are mostly about the ways each
one could be worse than doing nothing:

  a cap clamd cannot live inside turns one outage into a restart loop, so the
  ceiling has a floor;

  a swapfile created on the wrong filesystem, or inside a container, or on a
  nearly full disk, is a new outage rather than a fix, so every one of those is
  a skip;

  and the whole thing runs inside an installer, so it must never be able to
  fail one.
