"""Per-website SFTP sub-accounts.

The feature hands out a real Linux login. Four things carry its safety, and
each one is asserted here rather than left to review:

  the namespace     A sub-account name always starts with sftp_, and a panel
                    user may never take a name in that space. That disjointness
                    is the whole proof that no sub-account verb can be aimed at
                    a panel user, or the reverse.

  the chroot root   /var/lib/bpanel-sftp, owned by root. NOT under
                    /var/lib/bpanel, which belongs to the panel account. A
                    chroot root the confined account can write is not a
                    boundary - the same lesson the frontend/node_modules
                    finding taught, one directory over.

  the shared uid    Sub-accounts share the site owner's uid so uploaded files
                    keep working ownership. That makes the chroot the only
                    boundary, so nothing may weaken it, and teardown must never
                    reach for `pkill -u` or `userdel -r`.

  the sweeps        A deleted user, a deleted website and a suspended account
                    all have to reach these credentials. Missing one leaves a
                    working password pointing at somebody's files.
