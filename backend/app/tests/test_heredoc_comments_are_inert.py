"""Prose written into a generated file must not run as a command.

The helper builds config files with heredocs, and most of them are unquoted on
purpose - they interpolate a port, a path, a user name. Unquoted means the
shell expands the body, and that expansion does not stop at the parts you
meant it to reach.

A comment written in the habit of markdown was enough:

    # calls the unit ssh.service. The `+` is a disjunction in fail2ban, so the

The backticks are command substitution. Root ran `+`, and the helper printed
`line 1135: +: command not found` in the middle of installing a firewall
addon. It was harmless because `+` is not a command. `$(rm ...)` in the same
position would not have been.

So: a comment line inside an unquoted heredoc may not contain command
substitution. Substitution on a real config line stays allowed - that is what
unquoted heredocs are for, and the unattended-upgrades block uses it
deliberately.
