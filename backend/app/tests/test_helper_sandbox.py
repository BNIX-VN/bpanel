"""What the panel's own sandbox has to let the privileged helper do.

bpanel-api runs under a tight systemd sandbox. bpanel-helper runs as root
through sudo, but it starts as a *child of that process*, and several systemd
restrictions are inherited by children regardless of privilege. So every
capability the helper needs has to be granted on the unit, and
10-bpanel-helper.conf is the list of exactly that.

The list went stale. The security audit gave terminal-exec a mount-namespace
jail - `unshare --mount`, so a tenant's /home holds only their own directory -
and nobody added the matching grant. The unit said RestrictNamespaces=true,
which denies every namespace type to the process and everything it starts, so
the unshare failed with EPERM.

What that broke, from v1.0.141 until this fix: the file manager could list a
directory, because listing is a plain filesystem read in the API process, but
every file read and every save went through terminal-exec and returned 500.
The editor opened blank. Reported by a customer.

It was not caught because the jail had only ever been exercised from a root
SSH shell - the one context on the machine where this restriction does not
apply. A guarantee tested in the wrong context is not tested.
