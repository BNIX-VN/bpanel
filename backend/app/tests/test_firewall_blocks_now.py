"""Blocking an address has to stop an attack that is already under way.

A customer blocked 140.245.96.0/19 on a live server and watched 140.245.105.90
keep POSTing /wp-login.php for half an hour afterwards. The rule was right and
the ipset held the address; the packets never reached the rule. BPANEL-INPUT
returned on ESTABLISHED,RELATED before it consulted the deny sets, so every
connection the attacker had already opened stayed usable, and an HTTP
keep-alive is open for as long as the client wants it.

These tests pin the two halves of the answer: the deny sets are consulted
before the conntrack return, and applying the firewall closes sockets that the
sets now cover.
