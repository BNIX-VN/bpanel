/* Translation, keyed by the English sentence itself.
 *
 * `t('Websites')` looks up 'Websites' in the active dictionary and returns the
 * English back when there is no entry. Three things follow from that, and they
 * are the reason it is built this way rather than with named keys:
 *
 *   - A missing translation is invisible. The customer sees English, never an
 *     empty label or a raw key like `nav.websites`. So a half-finished
 *     dictionary is shippable, and a string added tomorrow does not have to
 *     wait for a translator before the feature goes out.
 *   - The code still reads as the interface. `t('Delete this website?')` in a
 *     diff says what it does; `t('sites.delete.confirm')` sends the reviewer
 *     to another file.
 *   - There is no key to get wrong. Renaming a key and forgetting one call
 *     site is the usual way named-key systems break, and it cannot happen
 *     here.
 *
 * The cost is that editing the English text orphans its translation, silently
 * - the string falls back to English and nobody is told. That is the right
 * trade for a panel whose English is already written and stable, and it is not
 * left to chance: test_i18n.py fails on any dictionary entry that no longer
 * matches a string in App.jsx or in an API message, so CI catches the orphan
 * on the commit that made it.
 *
 * No dependency. react-i18next and its ecosystem are a lot of machinery for a
 * lookup in an object, and this panel already prefers writing the small thing:
 * its own JSON-RPC rather than the mcp package, minio rather than boto3.
